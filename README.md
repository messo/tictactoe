Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

This is an implementation for a Tic-Tac-Toe player described by the [Player](src/main/java/com/topdesk/cases/tictactoe/Player.java) interface.
It incorporates the same method as Newell and Simon's (1972) tic-tac-toe: it iterates over a finite number of rules and it fires the first one
whose conditions are met.
