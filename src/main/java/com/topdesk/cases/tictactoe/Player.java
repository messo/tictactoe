 * A player in the game of Tic-tac-toe. A move made by the player follows an

 * result for the player. Winning is better than drawing is better than losing.

 * <p>
 * The player adheres to the traditional rules of the game: Two players, X and
 * O, take turns and occupy one of the {@link Field}s that is still
 * {@link FieldStatus#EMPTY}. Player X starts the game. The player who succeeds
 * in occupying three respective fields in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal
 * line wins the game. If the board is full, i.e. there are no empty fields
 * anymore, and none of the players managed to win, the game is drawn.
